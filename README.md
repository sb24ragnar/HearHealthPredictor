# HearHealthPredictor

**Project Overview**

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe complications and improving patient outcomes.

This project presents a machine learning–based heart disease prediction system built using the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset. The system predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on clinical and demographic features.

I've collected data source from UCI Machine Learning repositories , Cleveland heasrt disease dataset  is the very popular in usage and with less noise and almost complete data.

I've done some preprocessing and get the data prepared well for training and achieved better accuracy with the baseline models which are documented in the website,and achieved better accuracy with some hyper-parameter tuning.

And with the help of **EDA** i've able to find the flaws in the dataset that helped me to mould as i needed.

You can give a try implementing new ideas or models with the code and i'm happy to communicate or for any further help.

I had a further idea of implementing a user interface that can be interactive to the user rather finding hard.
